  <h2>Smart CCTV Surveillance with AI Analytics</h2>
  <p>
    Leverage existing CCTV networks with AI/ML integration for real-time crowd
    management, crime prevention, and workplace monitoring. Our AI-powered
    system analyzes live video feeds to detect patterns, recognize faces,
    identify suspicious activities, and predict potential risks. This
    intelligent approach enhances security by automating responses, ensuring
    safety compliance, and optimizing workflows—all while reducing human errors
    and maximizing the efficiency of existing infrastructure at minimal cost.
